# FORMATS

## General

This section specifies the formatting of the text, tables, and figures within the major parts of NTCIP documents. This section has the greatest application to NTCIP standards publications, but it can be used to define the format of other NTCIP documents.

## Specifications for Title Page

See Annex A1 for Title Page layout and font specifications.

## Pagination

NTCIP standards publications shall be published in two media—hardcopy, soft-covered, saddle-stapled format, and Adobe PDF™ electronic format. Because of the hardcopy format, pagination shall specify odd and even pages. When a saddle-stapled hardcopy document is open to interior pages, the even page shall be on the left, and the odd page shall be on the right.

The electronic format shall use the same even and odd pages and numbering of the hardcopy format.

The front matter NOTICES shall begin on the next page after the Title Page. In the hardcopy format, the NOTICES will be printed on the reverse of the Title Page.

The page numbering shall be consecutive lower case Roman numerals for the front matter ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS and subsequent pages. The page numbering shall be consecutive Arabic numbers for the sections and annexes. Consecutive numbering of all pages is considered to aid the document users. The “1-1” and “A-1” page numbering shall not be used.

Blank pages. Blank pages shall be inserted so that only the following content is placed on an odd page: CONTENTS, Section 1.

## Specification for Front Matter

Annex A2 specifies the templates for the organization and content of the Front Matter for NTCIP standards publications. The front matter includes the Notices, Acknowledgements, Foreword, Introduction, and Table of Contents. Reference the Annex A1, A2, or other A-numbered annex for the content and organization the front matter of the different numbered series of NTCIP standards publications.

Headers. There shall be no header on the pages with NOTICES. There shall be odd and even page headers with lower case Roman numeral page numbers for the pages with ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, FOREWARD, INTRODUCTION, and CONTENTS. All front matter major headers shall be capitalized.

Footers. There shall be odd and even page footers on all the front matter pages.

## Header and Footer Content

All 1000-, 2000-, and 8000-series NTCIP standards publications shall include a header and footer on all pages with normative and informative text, figures or tables, or pages intentionally left blank.

The header text is set in 10 point Arial. The document number, version, and page number should be as readable as the text.

The footer text is set in 9 point Arial. The copyright and duplication statement typically repeats for many pages and should not distract from the text.

The header and footer text shall be placed as follows:

- Headers. On odd pages, right justified, on the first line — the NTCIP document number plus the major.and minor version number. On the second line — Page and the page number. On even pages, the document number and Page number are left justified.

- Footers. On odd pages, the copyright “© YYYY ORG / ORG / ORG” shall be left justified, and the duplication warning or permission shall be right justified. On even pages, the copyright “© YYYY ORG” shall be right justified, and the duplication warning or permission shall be left justified. Therefore, on facing, hardcopy pages, the copyright is close to the gutter, and the duplication warning or permission is more visible on the outside edge

## General Specifications for Headings

The document section headings shall be as shown in Table 2.

## General Specifications for Text

The presentation (fonts, sizes, etc.) of text shall conform with NEMA NS 1 Section 4 and NS 1 Annex A, with the following exceptions:

1. Font. All text (headers, text, section titles, table titles, and figure titles) shall use the Arial font. The Title Page text shall use a combination of Arial and Arial Black as specified on the design template. MIB text shall use the Courier New font to set the MIB apart from the subclause headings and other sections.

Indenting. The first line of each paragraph shall not be indented.

Justification. All paragraph text in subclauses shall be Left Justified. All MIB text shall be Left Justified. Distribution Notices and sidebars and pull quotes can be Left-and-Right Justified to set these text blocks apart from the body of the document. The headings and footers shall be justified as above.

Tabs. There shall not be a tab stop at 0.25 inches.

Figure Title. The figure title shall be set in Arial, bold, 10 point type, with initial capitalization of each word except articles.

Table Title. The table title shall be set in Arial, bold, 10 point type, with initial capitalization of each word except articles.

## Style Guidance

Writing styles shall be consistent with NEMA NS 1 Section 5, except as noted.

### Dashes

Dashes are of three increasing lengths: the hyphen, the en-dash, and the em-dash. The intended use for each type of dash is described in Table 3. In the case of MIB modules, use care when selecting the type of dash, and whether the type of dash is located outside the MIB module text or is part of the MIB module.

Microsoft Word has AutoCorrect options that are enabled by default that may change a hyphens into en dashes.

The AutoFormat rule assumes that spaces are used either before or on both sides of dashes, and that text appears after or on both sides of hyphens. Therefore, if a space appears before a hyphen, Word replaces the hyphen with an en dash. If text appears before a hyphen, Word makes no change.

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

- If you want to use hyphens before and after your text, click AutoCorrect Options. This appears when you move the pointer over the corrected hyphen. Then, click Undo Dash.

- When you use AutoCorrect Options, you can also click Stop Automatically Creating Dashes, or click Control AutoCorrect Options to open the AutoCorrect dialog box.

- If you want to use en dashes instead of hyphens, insert a space before the hyphen. Word will automatically convert the hyphen into an en dash.

The en-dash and em-dash shall only be used in the clause, table, and figure text of NTCIP documents. Do not use en-dash and em-dash hyphens in the MIB section text of NTCIP documents. MIB compiling syntax errors occur with using two adjacent hyphens to end a comment, or to “comment-out” parts of an object definition, or when a line of hyphens is used to separate a MIB module section, or hyphens are used to draw an ASCII box figure.

There are other conflicting rules for the use of hyphens, such as hyphens being disallowed in MIB module identifiers. See NTCIP 8004 for additional guidance.

Here are other examples of hyphens forming compound adjectives. It’s long-distance service, but it is a long distance to Tipperary. [from Dan Bart, TIA, email 2007]

If adjectives can independently modify the associated noun, like small, red, sports car, not compound; but if they only make sense coupled together since independently they do not make sense, like small, red, low-cost sports car, then a hyphen should be used. Neither "low car" nor "cost car" make sense.

## Electronic Format

Final electronic versions of NTCIP documents shall be in Microsoft Word™ format. Electronic MIB files shall be distributed in ASCII text format. All other NTCIP documents that are distributed electronically to the public shall be in Adobe PDF™ format.
