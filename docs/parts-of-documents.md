### Acknowledgements

NTCIP standards publications with document numbers in the 1000-range and 2000-range shall contain an acknowledgement page. An acknowledgements page is optional in other NTCIP publications, such as 9000-series information reports, or amendments.

The acknowledgements page shall recognize the individuals and organizations that contributed to the development of the most recent major version of the document. The contributors shall be grouped and arranged in general order of importance, with the most important group (e.g., the individual WG members, researchers, authors, drafters, editors) first. Within each group, the names shall be listed alphabetically. The chair(s) shall be identified. Doctoral degrees and professional license suffixes may be included. Other job titles and employer names should not be included.

Other lower-order groups of contributors and reviewers may include: agencies providing funding used to develop the standard (e.g., the U.S. DOT / Federal Highway Administration), organization names that contributed but where individuals are not known or wish anonymity, standard development organizations, the NTCIP Joint Committee, and any other participants that the WG may wish to recognize.

In the event of a change in membership, change in chairperson, or death of a contributor, the individual’s name shall continue to be listed if they contributed to the most recent major version, and their change in status occurred between the prior and recent versions. The prior chair can be identified (e.g., past Chair). Other symbols (e.g., the dagger symbol) or dates or references shall not be used to indicate a former status or a change in status. The purpose of the acknowledgements is to provide a simple “thank you;” we do not wish to confuse the publication’s users.

In the event of the death of an important contributor, a single dedication sentence may be added as the last paragraph of the acknowledgements (e.g., This publication and version is dedicated to the memory of FirstName LastName).

### Foreword

All NTCIP publications, except amendments, shall contain a foreword.

The foreword shall consist of the following parts:

1. The address to which to send comments

2. A definition of how the document relates to other standards. Where possible, this should be supplemented by a graphic indicating its position in the ISO seven-layer model

3. A listing of any annexes included in the document

4. A listing of any aliases of the document (e.g., formerly known as…)

5. An identification of the document type (e.g., standard, guide, etc.) and a map to AASHTO/ITE/NEMA document types (See NTCIP 8001 Clause 3.6)

6. A reference to the NTCIP website with an alternate way to get a dated hardcopy of the website information

7. A reference of how to obtain a copy of the standard electronic MIB (for Data Dictionaries only)

8. List of Revisions. When an NTCIP standard is revised, a list of Clauses containing edits from the previous version shall be provided along with the page number where the change can be found.

### Introduction

All NTCIP publications, except amendments, shall contain an introduction.

The introduction shall consist of the following components:

1. A metrification statement

2. An abstract

3. A keyword list

4. A brief history of the document development, including the first meeting date but not the number of meetings.

### Table of Contents

All NTCIP documents, except for amendments, shall have a table of contents. The table of contents shall be consistent with NEMA NS 1 subclause 3.5.4.

### Main Body

The body of the document shall be contained in the main section(s). Each section shall be independently numbered.

### General Section

The first numbered section (Section 1) of all NTCIP standards and profiles shall be the general information section.

The general information section shall contain the same information as specified in NEMA NS-1 subclause 3.5.9.

The treatment and syntax for Normative and Informative references is specified in the subclause below.

The terms section shall list terms in a table with the first column set at 1.75 inches.For DEFINITIONS, a word or term shall be defined in only a single NTCIP standards publication. When the same word or term appears in other NTCIP standards publication, the definition(s) in the other standards publications shall preferably be a reference, such as “See NTCIP 0000 MM.NN, subsection 1.X.;” or be excerpted and reprinted with the attribution “Reprinted from NTCIP 0000 MM.NN, subsection 1.X.” Working Groups shall harmonize the appearance of definitions to locate or relocate a definition in the most appropriate and logical type of NTCIP standards publication, and then to make reference to the new home location in the next edition(s) of the other standards publications. [Added 071026 per BSP2 WG recommendation to the JC regarding “deprecation.”]

### Annex

NTCIP documents may contain annexes as appropriate. Annexes shall conform to the requirements as specified in NEMA NS-1 clause 3.6.

### Index

NTCIP documents may include an index if it would significantly aid the reader.

## Treatment of Normative References

The rules concerning normative references are given in ISO/IEC Directives Part 2, Clauses 10 and 15, except as described below.

### Policy

The subclause on "Normative References" should list all standards publications, including all available configuration management information (document numbers, version numbers, approval year, etc.) from which the referenced specifications are made or excerpted in other normative subclauses.

For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.

*3. No standards publication shall be elevated to an approval stage higher than the lowest stage of any normative reference made in the standard. [Vince -- does NEMA or ANSI explicitly state this in their P&P?] [em061213] See NTCIP 8001 draft Annex C2, QC Checklist, row C2.03.*

### Form

The list shall be introduced by the following wording:

“Normative references contain provisions that, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of this NTCIP document. At the time of publication, the editions indicated were valid. All standards are subject to revision, and parties to agreements based on this NTCIP document are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions of the standards listed.”

The correct form for the normative reference is the complete and unambiguous syntax to be used in the citation of the reference. [Vicki -- Any good examples?] After selecting a normative reference, the draft author shall explicitly indicate what parts are included, to comply with the "... in whole or in part AS INDICATED, ..." part of the instruction. [em061213]

For dated references, each shall be given with its full version number and year of Joint Approval. In the case of drafts or Recommended documents, give the latest full version number together with a suffix "To be published.", and full title.

When a reference is to all parts of a document, the publication number shall be followed by the indication "(all parts)" and the general title of the series of parts (i.e. the introductory and main elements). When a reference is to certain parts, sections, or clauses, the publication number shall be followed by the indication of which parts “(Subclause 2.2).” [based on ISO/IEC Dir 2001 Part 2, 6.2.2]

### Configuration Management of Reference Notices and Agreements

Configuration Management practice should be applied to the normative references on “both sides” of the subject standards publication. That is, the policy in the above subclauses shall be applied to the Normative References listed in the subject standard.

The NTCIP WG shall send a notice to the authoring committee or publishing SDO for all listed Normative References, and notes shall be recorded of the agreements made.

Notices shall be received by the authoring NTCIP WG, and agreements issued by NEMA, to have the authoring WG’s standard included as a Normative Reference in the document of the other body. Notes shall be recorded of the agreements made, such as in an annex.

An optional, informative annex should be considered which lists the other documents known to include the subject standard as a normative reference. Then when any maintenance or approval actions are taken with the subject standard, there will be a convenient list of the other WGs, committees, or SDOs which may be affected by the maintenance action. The other WGs, committees, or SDOs should be notified to seek their input, or to inform them that a new version will be available for them to consider an update or revision in their own document.

Following the configuration practice of notices and agreements allows the chain of dependencies to be more clearly identified, and thus schedules can be coordinated and revisions planned.

Sample annex title:

ANNEX N  
List of Other Known Standards Publications Citing NTCIP 0000 as a Reference

The creation and maintenance of a citation annex depends somewhat on the knowledge of the WG members, and the known agreements obtained by the authors or publishers of the citing documents.

### Guidance

There are four steps in creating well-documented and explicit normative references, which include:

1. Explicit reference to SDO, document number, version, edition, and last known approval stage when draft written.

2. Coordination of approval stages, for either "Other SDOs" or "In house / Within the Family" documents.

3. Reference with limits and amendments. Exactly which subclauses of the normative reference apply? And where do those subclauses apply in the subclauses of the referencing document? And how is the norm ref amended in its application to the target / referencing doc?

4. Has the owner of the norm reference been notified of the dependency, or permission requested to excerpt material?

## Treatment of Informative References

The list shall be introduced by the following wording:

“The following documents and standards may provide the reader with a more complete understanding of this NTCIP document*.* However, these documents do not contain direct provisions that are required by this NTCIP document. ”

## On-Line References

Registries are the only on-line reference currently defined by the NTCIP effort. On-line references shall consist of a home page containing the following links:

- Acknowledgements

- Foreword

- Introduction

- Registry Tables (one for each major category)

In addition, the home page shall also include the copyright statement defined in Clause 4.2.

The acknowledgements, foreword, and introduction shall be as defined in Clause 3.2.3 – 3.2.6.

The registry tables shall define the appropriate information for each entry.
