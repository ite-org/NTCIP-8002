# DOCUMENT NUMBERING AND CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

## Terminology Hierarchy

The NTCIP defines the following hierarchy of terms when making collective reference to NTCIP documents. In the figure below, the term above collects the terms below the higher term.

**Figure 1 NTCIP Document Terminology Hierarchy**

The collection on NTCIP documents is also called the “NTCIP family of documents” to show the association of the NTCIP trademark and to differentiate the NTCIP from other standards publications of AASHTO, ITE, and NEMA.

## Document Numbering Scheme

The NTCIP documents, as well as the Advanced Transportation Controller (ATC) documents, are assigned four-digit numbers from the following reserved ranges of numbers, based on the expected content of the proposed work item to which the number is assigned. The assigned number series is defined in Table 1. The NTCIP Coordinator serves as the document number registrar.

| 2000              | NTCIP profiles are standards that reference one or more other standards to define the details of implementation, or to express a higher-level view of the major functional aspects of communications. In general, profiles are used to define how to combine a set of base standards to achieve a specific set of functionality. The profiles will often require the implementation of certain optional features of base standards to ensure interoperability of the desired features. Profiles are useful as they provide an unambiguous definition of how to implement base standards.  The only standard published in this series was NTCIP 2001 which has been rescinded. It was a rename rename of TS 3.3:1996 under the previous NEMA standards identification method.  There are three other series of profiles for subnetwork, transport, and application. |

Any assigned numbers shall not be re-used until the end of the range or series is reached.

## Version and Edition Configuration Management

All NTCIP documents have the same basic naming convention. The full title of any NTCIP approved or published document is of the following format, with explanations as below:

NTCIP NNNN version MMA *Title in Italics*

The full title of any NTCIP draft or recommended document is of the following format, with explanations as below:

NTCIP NNNN vMMA.RRa Stage *Title in Italics*

Where:

NNNN = the four digit number of the standard. See the document numbering scheme in Section 2.2.

vMMA = the lower case letter “v” for version, followed by a two digit major version number. If the major version number is v01 to v09, a leading zero is used as a placeholder. “A” represents an optional letter where a standard is published with the same major version number that was previously published.

.RR = the character “.” followed by a two digit minor revision number.

a = the publication edition, which may include revision to the front matter and formatting to prepare the document for publication.

Stage = the stage of development. The development stage shall be the stage spelled out, or a letter code as the suffix. The letter codes shall be Working Group Draft (WGD), User Comment Draft (UCD), and Recommended Standard (RS). If the document is being submitted for ballot to a new stage, the proposed document stage shall be preceded by the word “PROPOSED.” For the various minor version numbers within the WGD stage, the Stage text or document filename may also include notes on the revision date, author or reviewer’s initials, or other differentiating text.

The standard number is a number assigned by the NTCIP Assigned Numbers Authority (NANA) after the Joint Committee approves the proposal to develop the standard. The NEMA NTCIP Coordinator is the NANA. The major version number is the next most important component of the identifier for an NTCIP document. When referring to NTCIP documents within text, the document identifier can be presented in any of the following syntaxes: NTCIP NNNN version MM, or NTCIP NNNN vMM, or version vMM, or version MM. The following are not proper references: “version 1”, nor “version v1”, nor “Version One”.

As of 2008, the year of Joint Approval was removed from the document identifier to focus attention on the major version number and to avoid confusion with the month and year of publication.

The minor version revision number is used to unambiguously reference a specific minor version of the body of the document during the development process.

The major and minor version numbers shall be incremented according to the following rules.

1. The major version number shall be incremented (and the minor version reset to “01”) upon commencement of an effort to revise a previously published version when:

- the WG plans to revise normative content beyond what can be considered as a maintenance update (e.g., clarification, editorial corrections, etc);

- the WG plans to significantly re-organize the existing content.

2. The minor version number shall be incremented (and any publication edition letter removed) during the development and maintenance of any numbered NTCIP document when:

- any change is made to normative or informative text in the body of the document, and after a previous version of the document had been distributed to others, even if the distribution was only to one other person;

- twelve months have elapsed, and the document is still being developed, and has not yet been accepted at the next development stage;

- text from an approved amendment is incorporated into the body of the document.

3. The publication edition letter is added/incremented when:

- Any change is made to the document other than to the body of the document (e.g., changes to the title page, front matter, or header/footer text).

    Final edits during the publication process can result in updates to the minor version number and/or edits to the publication edition due to multiple reviews.

### Use of Amendments Discontinued

As of 2008, drafting an Amendment to NTCIP standards publications is not recommended. The NTCIP standard shall be revised by drafting the next major version number. This section is here as a historical reference only.

1. Amendments to NTCIP standards publications have consecutive numeric Amendment numbers as a suffix to the four-digit document number, plus a single, two-digit minor version numbers for configuration management, e.g., "1205 Amendment 1 v10". There would never be a new "major" version number of an amendment; the next amendment number, like Amendment 2, would be assigned.

2. When an amendment is offered for any of the stages of User Comment review or acceptance or ballot and approval, the amended portion can either be presented as a separate document with notes to “replace the text at subclause 9.9.9 with the following amended text,” or if the amendment covers a larger scope and multiple subclauses, the amendment can be presented in the context of a revised document.

3. The Title Page shall show “Amendment 1 v00 to NTCIP 0000 v01.11” to indicate the last Jointly Approved standard that is being amended.

4. When the amendment is also Jointly Approved, the amended standard shall have the minor version incremented, and the title page shall show that the Amendment is incorporated. To help avoid confusion with only a single digit change, the minor version can be incremented to the next tens-place. For example, 1299 v02.15 has been Jointly Approved and published; Amendment 3 v07 to v02.15 achieves Joint Approval; then 1299 v02.21 is published that “includes Amendment 3.”
