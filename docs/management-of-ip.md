# MANAGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

## Original contributions to NTCIP Documents

The writers and publishers of NTCIP standards publications shall comply with all U.S. and international copyright law. See the NTCIP Web site for additional information.

AASHTO, ITE, and NEMA have agreed on the terms and conditions for rights and procedures as specified in the MOU on Copyright, Trademark, and Publishing Administration.

The NTCIP Joint Committee members, WG members, expert consultants, and document editors are all instructed that in accordance with AASHTO, ITE, NEMA, and NTCIP policy, their contributions to NTCIP documents are the intellectual property of AASHTO, ITE, and NEMA, unless otherwise provided.

## Claiming NTCIP Copyrights

All NTCIP standards publications shall include a copyright statement as shown in Annex A or Annex B.

Data Dictionary Standards (1200 series) shall include a MIB distribution statement as shown in Annex A and all Profiles (2000 series) shall include a PICS distribution statement as shown in Annex A.

Registries (7000 series) and Process, Control, and Information Management Policies (8000 series) shall be posted on the NTCIP Web site, but shall include a copyright statement shown in Annex B.

Informational Reports (9000 series) shall be posted on the NTCIP Web site. However, in order to ensure that the information is not used out of context, the title page shall display the following copyright statement:

[2003 Revision for 9000 series] © 2003 AASHTO / ITE / NEMA. All rights reserved. Permission to copy without fee all or part of this Information Report is granted for the following noncommercial use, without editing or modification: (a) downloading the electronic file, and making up to 30 copies of the file by electronic mail distribution or disk reproduction; (b) printing one copy, and reproducing and distributing up to 30 printed copies; and (c) excerpts limited to 5 or fewer pages. Provided that all the foregoing use includes the © AASHTO / ITE / NEMA copyright notice; along with a notice that the copy is reprinted with permission; and along with the title, document number, and date; all of which appear on each copy. Permission is not granted for the following use: (i) republishing in compendiums or anthologies; (ii) publishing excerpts in commercial publications or works for hire; (iii) display in electronic storage devices or methods on networks; and (iv) in translations to other languages. Other use requires prior written consent; see the Request form in the [www.ntcip.org](http://www.ntcip.org) Library.

The Copyright Date

The year of copyright (“© 20YY”) included in the Copyright Statement in the front matter and in the document footers, shall be:

- for stages WGD and UCD, the year the draft was last authored or revised. This draft then shows the year that copyright may be claimed. Alternatively for drafts, no year need be listed, only “© AASHTO / ITE / NEMA.”

- for stage RS or for Recommended Information Reports, the year the proposed document was accepted as Recommended by the Joint Committee. Again, this document then shows the year that copyright may be claimed. If a Form TX is filed for a Recommended Information Report, the year shall be the year of filing Form TX.

- for Jointly Approved standards, the year of filing Form TX with the U.S. Copyright Office.

For WGD and UCD documents undergoing multi-year development, only the single, most recent year of authorship or revision shall be shown. Multi-year ranges, such as “200X-200Y,” shall not be used.

For documents with new major versions, the copyright shall list two or more years, including the first year of Form TX filing for the first major version, and the single most recent year of authorship or revision. When the new major version is Jointly Approved, the additional copyright year shall be the year of filing Form TX.

For example, 120N v01.17 was Jointly Approved in 1998, and a new major version WGD was started in 2002. The copyright line would list “© 1998 and 2002 AASHTO / ITE / NEMA.” If the revision work continued from 2002 into 2003 and 2004, the drafts in each of those years would list “© 1998 and 2003” and “© 1998 and 2004” when each minor version was authored in that year.

For another example, 120N v03.09 was Jointly Approved in 2007. The copyright line in v03.09 would list “© 1997, 2003, 2007 AASHTO / ITE / NEMA” for the three Form TX filing dates of the Jointly Approved and published major versions.
