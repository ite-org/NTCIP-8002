# Foreword

## Overview

This document is an NTCIP Open-Source NTCIP Process, Control, and Information Management document provided as Interim for Field Release (IFR).

Open-source documents are developed using the ITS Open-Source Process, as defined in NTCIP 8008. This process provides an open standards development process that accepts issues reported by the community and resolved by peer-reviewed contributions from the community. The open source process concludes with the resultant material being approved by the defined approval process.

IFR documents are approved through a streamlined process focused on the technical experts of the community (e.g., those participating in the open-source development process) rather than through a formal ballot of industry managers.

NTCIP Process, Control, and Information Management documents define the practices and policies used by the NTCIP Joint Committee and its working groups in developing and maintaining NTCIP publications.

This document defines the general rules for the content and format of NTCIP standards publications.

This publication was developed to ensure that NTCIP documents are well organized and have a consistent style both within a given document as well as among all NTCIP documents. The style rules used are largely based on the rules governing NEMA documents (as defined in NEMA NS 1), with modifications to meet the needs of the NTCIP effort. There are two normative annexes to this document.

## Approvals

IFRs are peer reviewed within the open-source process with final approval by an associated WG established by the NTCIP Joint Committee.

Approval information is provided within the online environment.

## User Comment Instructions

Comments can be submitted at any time. In preparation of this NTCIP standards publication, input of users and other interested parties was sought and evaluated.

Comments on open-source projects can be submitted either on the [discussions](https://github.com/ite-org/NTCIP-8008/discussions) or [issues](https://github.com/ite-org/NTCIP-8008/issues) tab of the
project.

Discussions can be initiated at any time and anyone in the community can respond, all within a public environment. Responses to discussion comments are strictly informative and may not be accurate. Discussion comments can lead to the submittal of issues that need to be resolved to clarify the standard.

Issues can be submitted at any time. Issues are triaged by the project maintainer, who will evaluate their merit, classify them (e.g., as a bug, documentation issue, omission), and in most cases respond to the submitter. Once ready, issues will be available for contributors to volunteer to address. When a volunteer has a proposed solution, it can be submitted to the project and approved in a relatively short period (when compared to the traditional standards approval process). However, updates to the projects are still version controlled so that users can reference a specific version of the project without fear of it changing.

Comments should use the templates provided on the website; otherwise they may be ignored.
