This standards development activity has been transferred to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Status is to be determined. 2000 NTCIP profiles are standards that reference one or more other standards to define the details of implementation, or to express a higher-level view of the major functional aspects of communications. In general, profiles are used to define how to combine a set of base standards to achieve a specific set of functionality. The profiles will often require the implementation of certain optional features of base standards to ensure interoperability of the desired features. Profiles are useful as they provide an unambiguous definition of how to implement base standards.  The only standard published in this series was NTCIP 2001 which has been rescinded. It was a rename rename of TS 3.3:1996 under the previous NEMA standards identification method.  There are three other series of profiles for subnetwork, transport, and application. 2100 NTCIP subnetwork profiles define the standard combinations of Data Link and Physical Layer protocols as used within NTCIP systems. 2200 NTCIP transport profiles define the standard combinations of Transport and Network Layer protocols as used within NTCIP systems. 2300 NTCIP application profiles define the standard combinations of application, presentation and session layer protocols as used within NTCIP systems. 2500 NTCIP Center-to-Center (C2C) information profiles. Need input from Center-to-Center WG if this series should still be maintained. Status of this series is to be determined.

Values 5100 through 5199 are reserved for TMDD and related standards publication designation. Currently, TMDD is under a different numbering system. Input is required from the Center-to-Center WG.
